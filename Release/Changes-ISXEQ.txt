- Added command converted by SlimJim
  * Where
- Set up handling for ISXEQ data type methods.  Methods are declared in MQ2DataTypes.h, but
  the GetMethod function is implemented in ISXEQDataTypes.cpp
- Added data type methods:
  spawn.Target: Targets the spawn.  ex: Me:Target
  buff.Remove: Removes the buff. ex: Me.Buff[1]:Remove
  window.LeftMouseDown: Presses the left mouse button on the center of the window (you MUST 
                        follow with a left mouse up. Generally you do NOT want to use this!)
  window.LeftMouseUp: Presses and then releases the left mouse button on the center of the window
                      (generally you want to use this instead of LeftMouseDown at all)
  window.LeftMouseHeldDown: Presses the left mouse button on the center of the window, and tells 
                            the window that the button was *held* (you MUST follow with a left 
                            mouse held up. Generally you do NOT want to use this!)
  window.LeftMouseHeldUp: Presses and then releases the left mouse button on the center of the 
                          window, and tells the window that the button was *held* (generally you
                          want to use this instead of LeftMouseHeldDown at all)
  window.RightMouseDown: Presses the right mouse button on the center of the window (you MUST 
                        follow with a right mouse up. Generally you do NOT want to use this!)
  window.RightMouseUp: Presses and then releases the right mouse button on the center of the window
                      (generally you want to use this instead of RightMouseDown at all)
  window.RightMouseHeldDown: Presses the right mouse button on the center of the window, and tells 
                            the window that the button was *held* (you MUST follow with a right 
                            mouse held up. Generally you do NOT want to use this!)
  window.RightMouseHeldUp: Presses and then releases the right mouse button on the center of the 
                          window, and tells the window that the button was *held* (generally you
                          want to use this instead of RightMouseHeldDown at all)
  window.ListSelect[#]: Selects item # in a combo or list

- This release requires ISXDK version 8b
- Converted ALL data types, and all TLOs besides the following:
  NearestSpawn
  Ini
  LineOfSight - Will be different from original.  Original used special handling for a :,
                but must no longer do so
- Most commands still need to be converted

24 February 2005 by Lax
- Added commands converted by JGC84 and SlimJim (fixed where appropriate)
  * MacroBeep
  * Ranged
  * SetAutoRun
  * DisplayLoginName
  * PopupText
  * SellItem
  * BuyItem

- /who conversion (untested).  Props to JGC84 for giving it a shot, though it was a
  little too complicated for him so I fixed it up :)

15 February 2005 by Lax
- Updated for ISXDK v8a (naming changes).  ISXDK v8a will be made available soon.

4 February 2005 by Lax
- ISXEQ now does stuff, and I've found some issues in IS that will be corrected soon.
  ISXEQ does require ISXDK v7 which is not yet available, but will be if anyone reads
  this and asks...
- Memory protection works correctly
- IS commands (including ISXEQ commands) can be entered from EQ by prefixing with #, 
  e.g. #echo hi.  This may be changed in the future, but is acceptable for now
- EQ commands can be entered from IS by using the "EQExecute" command, e.g. EQExecute /who
- /keypress converted
- /bind converted (to MQ2Bind, since bind is already used in IS)
- Still plenty to do:
  * Commands must be converted
  * Command API can be udpated to add a method of executing ISXEQ commands with /command
  * Data types
  * Top-Level Objects

1 February 2005 by Lax
- ISXEQ now compiles, but does not do everything yet (actually, with no changes does
  nothing more than enable memory protection)
  * Initialization and shutdown sequences must be completed
  * Commands must be converted
  * Command API must be converted -- use MQ2's command injection system, and also use
    slash-less versions of each command for the IS console
  * Data types must be converted
  * Top level objects must be converted
- Services are completed, which use MQ2's existing Plugin functionality but transfer
  the function calls to service broadcasts
