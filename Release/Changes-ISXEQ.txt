- This release requires ISXDK version 8b
- Converted ALL data types, and all TLOs besides the following:
  NearestSpawn
  Ini
  LineOfSight - Will be different from original.  Original used special handling for a :,
                but must no longer do so
- Most commands still need to be converted

24 February 2005 by Lax
- Added commands converted by JGC84 and SlimJim (fixed where appropriate)
  * MacroBeep
  * Ranged
  * SetAutoRun
  * DisplayLoginName
  * PopupText
  * SellItem
  * BuyItem

- /who conversion (untested).  Props to JGC84 for giving it a shot, though it was a
  little too complicated for him so I fixed it up :)

15 February 2005 by Lax
- Updated for ISXDK v8a (naming changes).  ISXDK v8a will be made available soon.

- ISXEQ now does stuff, and I've found some issues in IS that will be corrected soon.
  ISXEQ does require ISXDK v7 which is not yet available, but will be if anyone reads
  this and asks...
- Memory protection works correctly
- IS commands (including ISXEQ commands) can be entered from EQ by prefixing with #, 
  e.g. #echo hi.  This may be changed in the future, but is acceptable for now
- EQ commands can be entered from IS by using the "EQExecute" command, e.g. EQExecute /who
- /keypress converted
- /bind converted (to MQ2Bind, since bind is already used in IS)
- Still plenty to do:
  * Commands must be converted
  * Command API can be udpated to add a method of executing ISXEQ commands with /command
  * Data types
  * Top-Level Objects

1 February 2005 by Lax
- ISXEQ now compiles, but does not do everything yet (actually, with no changes does
  nothing more than enable memory protection)
  * Initialization and shutdown sequences must be completed
  * Commands must be converted
  * Command API must be converted -- use MQ2's command injection system, and also use
    slash-less versions of each command for the IS console
  * Data types must be converted
  * Top level objects must be converted
- Services are completed, which use MQ2's existing Plugin functionality but transfer
  the function calls to service broadcasts
