- MacroQuest program will no longer use loadlibrary, it loads our library directly.
- The version number is now stored in MQ2Main.h as the top line, and not in macroquest.ini.  When compiled it becomes a global variable.  Comparing the global variable gszVersion with the #define in MQ2Main.h will cause the tray icon tooltip to suggest recompiling if necessary.

+Added new command /destroy
will destroy whatever you have on your cursor. Use with care.
example: /if "$cursor(name)"~~"rusty" /destroy
In order to get that to work I had to declare EQ_PC (MQ2Globals.h(250):EQLIB_VAR EQ_PC **ppPCData;)
