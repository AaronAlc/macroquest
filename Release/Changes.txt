fix for $merchant(name)

*** MacroQuest2.exe is now pre-compiled, you no longer compile this yourself.  MQ2Auth implemented.  Run it before compiling on each machine.

- MacroQuest program will no longer use loadlibrary, it loads our library directly.
- The version number is now stored in MQ2Main.h as the top line, and not in macroquest.ini.  When compiled it becomes a global variable.  Comparing the global variable gszVersion with the #define in MQ2Main.h will cause the tray icon tooltip to suggest recompiling if necessary.
- Removed EQADDR_SLOTLIST, which is now ppInvSlotMgr/pInvSlotMgr
- Fixed MQ2Telnet crashes (for real)
- Added DebugSpewNoFile which does not write to file even if debugspewtofile=1.  This is useful for when we can't put up with the file access times.  All Macro commands and parser api debug spew has been changed to this form.  Note that this debug spew is still useful for when you attach a debugger.

+Added new command /destroy
will destroy whatever you have on your cursor. Use with care.
example: /if "$cursor(name)"~~"rusty" /destroy
In order to get that to work I had to declare EQ_PC (MQ2Globals.h(250):EQLIB_VAR EQ_PC **ppPCData;)

- Fixed MQ2Telnet to not crash on unload (probably).  Critical sections were getting deleted twice.
- Fixed aliases to work when given parameters
