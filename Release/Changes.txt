- MQ2Map upgrade is now live.  It uses the new OnAddSpawn/OnRemoveSpawn API to increase efficiency.
  /highlight <spawn search string> will temporarily highlight these spawns
  /highlight color <#> <#> <#> will set the highlight color
  /highlight reset to reset the currently highlighted spawns
  Right clicking on spawns on the map now targets them
- /keypress command is now live. /keypress <name> <hold> like so:
  /keypress clear_target
  /keypress forward hold
  To release the key after holding, simply use the command again without the hold keyword.
- /itemnotify command is now live.  /itemnotify <slot> <notification>, or /itemnotify in <bag slot> <#> <notification>
  Bag slots are pack1-8, bank1-16 (and sharedbank1-2 and trade1-8 but these are not yet implemented in /itemnotify)
- Added OnAddGroundSpawn/OnRemoveGroundSpawn to plugin callbacks
- Fixed random crash on exit dealing with breakpoints

    According to Pragma:
        1 bug: in the code for $rand(), there needs to be a srand(time(0));
        2 bug: in the code for $gamestate, $servername, and $loginname, the 
            value returned is 1 too high. You need to return length-1, which 
            is 8 for loginname and gamestate, and 9 for servername, this will 
            fix parsing issues.

18 Jan 2004 by Amadeus

  [http://macroquest.sourceforge.net/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?p=33124#33124]
- Added Uninterruptable and Autocast to SPELL along with other fixes (thanks SoF & Koad)
- Added more functionality to the Spell Inspect Window.  You will now see the Effect of the 
  spell and the classes that can use it.  You might really find it interesting to 
  Alt-LeftClick on some of your buffs and find out exactly what they are doing to you!  It's
  almost like having an ingame Lucy connection -- and we owe a great deal of this functionality
  to Koad and borrowed code from his spellsearch plugin.
  
  **NOTE:  The formulas for this are still being tweaked.  If you wish to help iron these
           out, please post under Koad's thread on MQ2:Plugins board.  He is the keeper of 
           of the spell effects/slots formula. **

29 Dec 2003 by Lax
- MQ2Auth modified.

    * MQ2Auth will import existing MQ2Auth2.h into MQ2Auth0.h if MQ2Auth0.h does not
      already exist but MQ2Auth2.h (in other words, it will import your "keyring" to
      MQ2Auth0.h)
    * MQ2Auth now accepts a command line parameter telling it the path to use
- Merged BOOK, COMMON, CONTAINER structs into ITEMINFO (the individual structs no

  about spells when you "examine" a spell from a gem or your spellbook: ID, Duration, 
  RecoveryTime, RecastTime, Range, AERange, PushBack, Resist Type and Resist Adjust.  
  You will notice that if a spell doesn't have any of these values, then that field 
  will not be shown at all.  (**More functionality to come later**)
- Added MQ2Bzrsearch to the VS.net solution file.

27 Nov 2003 by Lax
- / command correctly does EQ /who by default
- MQ2Telnet redone.
- Plugins using DoCommand() will execute it on the next pulse instead of immediately (corrects problems unloading the plugin)
- MQ2FPS shouldn't cause major problems when switching from absolute to calculate mode
- MQ2Template removed from VS6 workspace and .NET solution

25 Nov 2003 by Lax
- MQ2FPS now has a /fps command that can change some other settings.  Selecting "absolute" mode will switch to "cpu limiter" style, while "calculate" mode will switch to "fps limiter" style.  FPS limiter is default.  The same command will allow you to reposition the FPS indicator display.
- MQ2FPS display now shows a * if using absolute mode, and will show /MACRO if a macro is being executed that causes the limiting to be minimal
- Added aliases /g and /gu to the default list
- Macroquest2.exe now pops up a message box if the system failed to load MQ2Main.dll

20 Nov 2003 by EqMule
fix for $merchant(name)

20 Nov 2003 by Lax
*** MacroQuest2.exe is now pre-compiled, you no longer compile this yourself.  MQ2Auth implemented.  Run it before compiling on each machine.

- MacroQuest program will no longer use loadlibrary, it loads our library directly.
- The version number is now stored in MQ2Main.h as the top line, and not in macroquest.ini.  When compiled it becomes a global variable.  Comparing the global variable gszVersion with the #define in MQ2Main.h will cause the tray icon tooltip to suggest recompiling if necessary.
- Removed EQADDR_SLOTLIST, which is now ppInvSlotMgr/pInvSlotMgr
- Fixed MQ2Telnet crashes (for real)
- Added DebugSpewNoFile which does not write to file even if debugspewtofile=1.  This is useful for when we can't put up with the file access times.  All Macro commands and parser api debug spew has been changed to this form.  Note that this debug spew is still useful for when you attach a debugger.

19 Nov 2003 by EqMule
+Added new command /destroy
will destroy whatever you have on your cursor. Use with care.
example: /if "$cursor(name)"~~"rusty" /destroy
In order to get that to work I had to declare EQ_PC (MQ2Globals.h(250):EQLIB_VAR EQ_PC **ppPCData;)

19 Nov 2003 by Lax
- Fixed MQ2Telnet to not crash on unload (probably).  Critical sections were getting deleted twice.
- Fixed aliases to work when given parameters

18 Nov 2003 by EqMule
+fix: mouseto and click by changing ScreenX and ScreenY to ScrX and ScrY)
+Added  EQLIB_API VOID AddParm(PCHAR Name, fMQParm Function);
    EQLIB_API VOID RemoveParm(PCHAR Name);
to MQ2Main.h so that custom plugins will find them...
+updated $merchant(has,xxx) with HanzO's code for it, thank you.
+Updated $selecteditem() with new (count) for easier usage of /sellitem and /buyitem
example: /sellitem $selecteditem(count) self
+misc fixes...
